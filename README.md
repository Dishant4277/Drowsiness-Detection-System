# Drowsiness Detection System  

🚗 **Prevent drowsy driving accidents with AI-powered detection!** 🚗

## 📌 About the Project
Drowsy driving is a major safety hazard, causing numerous accidents worldwide. Our system leverages deep learning to monitor driver alertness and provide timely warnings, ensuring safer roads. 

## 🔍 Features
- **Real-time face detection** using Mediapipe.
- **Facial landmark analysis** for drowsiness detection.
- **Image preprocessing** (cropping, resizing, augmentation).
- **CNN-based deep learning model** for classification.
- **Google Colab compatibility** for easy deployment.

## 📁 Dataset & Preprocessing
- **Face Detection**: Identifies faces from images.
- **Landmark Mapping**: Marks key facial points.
- **Resizing**: Standardizes image dimensions.
- **Label Encoding & Augmentation**: Enhances model performance.

## 🏗 Model Architecture
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on processed images to detect drowsiness effectively. The architecture includes:
- **Convolutional layers** for feature extraction.
- **Pooling layers** for dimensionality reduction.
- **Fully connected layers** for classification.
